## BSQ
BSQ is used to find the biggest square which can be made with the "1" in a grid made of 1 and 0 (0 being the obstacles). If there are two squares (or more) being the same zise, the first one is selected.  
The grid needs to be typed manually.  
The project was introduced to me as an exercice they have to do in some computing school, like 42. Students have to do it using C but since I had started learning Python for a week, I wanted to try to see if I was able to do it or not.
