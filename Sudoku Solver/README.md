## SUDOKU SOLVER  
The SUDOKU SOLVER can be used to solve any grid.
The grid needs to be typed manually.
It is using a backtracking method, selecting the first valid option for every cell, and going to the next when. When a cell doesn't have any valid option, the program is going back to the previous cell, until a valid option is found (then go forward again).

This is the first project in Python I had made. I wanted to do it without using any external libraries, and didn't much about them anyway at that time. The way I am naming the variables and functions is not very conventional, since I didn't know about that neither.

### Programming language:
PYTHON 3
> How long I have been learning this language when the project was made? 3 days~

### Authors:  
Dylan J. Gerrits
